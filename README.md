## 🤓 Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

#### ERD - Diagram <br>

## 🛠️ Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## 📚 Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:13.0
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../src/dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## 📊 Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL querys to achieve the following results:

1. Count the total number of states in each country.

```
SELECT c.name, COUNT(s.name) AS count FROM countries AS c JOIN states AS s ON c.id = s.country_id GROUP BY c.name;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result1.png" alt="result_1"/>
</p>

2. How many employees do not have supervisores.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS employees_without_bosses FROM employees WHERE supervisor_id IS NULL;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result2.png" alt="result_2"/>
</p>

3. List the top five offices address with the most amount of employees, order the result by country and display a column with a counter.

```
SELECT c.name, o.address, COUNT(e.office_id) AS count FROM employees AS e JOIN offices AS o ON e.office_id = o.id JOIN countries AS c ON o.country_id = c.id GROUP BY c.name, o.address ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 5;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result3.png" alt="result_3"/>
</p>

4. Three supervisors with the most amount of employees they are in charge.

```
SELECT supervisor_id, COUNT(id) AS count FROM employees WHERE supervisor_id IS NOT NULL GROUP BY supervisor_id ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 3;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result4.png" alt="result_4"/>
</p>

5. How many offices are in the state of Colorado (United States).

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS list_of_office FROM offices AS o JOIN states AS s ON o.state_id = s.id WHERE s.name = 'Colorado';
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result5.png" alt="result_5"/>
</p>

6. The name of the office with its number of employees ordered in a desc.

```
SELECT o.name, COUNT(e.office_id) AS count FROM offices AS o JOIN employees AS e ON e.office_id = o.id GROUP BY o.name ORDER BY count DESC;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result6.png" alt="result_6"/>
</p>

7. The office with more and less employees.

```
WITH EmployeeCount AS (
    SELECT 
        e.office_id, 
        COUNT(e.id) AS count
    FROM employees AS e
    GROUP BY e.office_id
),
MaxOffice AS (
    SELECT o.address, ec.count
FROM EmployeeCount AS ec
JOIN offices AS o ON o.id = ec.office_id
WHERE ec.count = (
        SELECT MAX(count) FROM EmployeeCount
    )
    LIMIT 1
),
MinOffice AS (
    SELECT o.address, ec.count
    FROM EmployeeCount AS ec
    JOIN offices AS o ON o.id = ec.office_id
    WHERE ec.count = (
        SELECT MIN(count) FROM EmployeeCount
    )
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT address, count
FROM MaxOffice
UNION ALL
SELECT address, count
FROM MinOffice
;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result7.png" alt="result_7"/>
</p>

8. Show the uuid of the employee, first_name and lastname combined, email, job_title, the name of the office they belong to, the name of the country, the name of the state and the name of the boss (boss_name)

```
SELECT e.uuid, 
concat(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name) AS full_name, 
e.email, 
e.job_title,
o.name AS company,
c.name AS country,
s.name AS state,
em.first_name AS boss_name
FROM employees AS e
JOIN offices AS o ON e.office_id = o.id
JOIN countries AS c ON o.country_id = c.id
JOIN states AS s ON o.state_id = s.id
LEFT JOIN employees AS em ON e.id = em.supervisor_id
;
```
