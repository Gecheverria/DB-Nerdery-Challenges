## ü§ì Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

#### ERD - Diagram <br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## üìö Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:15.2
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

5. Close the database connection:
```
\q
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## üìä Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL queries to achieve the following results (You need to write the query in the section `Your query here` on each question):

1. Total money of all the accounts group by types.

```
SELECT type, SUM(mount) 
FROM accounts 
GROUP BY type 
HAVING type = 'SAVING_ACCOUNT' OR type = 'CURRENT_ACCOUNT';
```


2. How many users with at least 2 `CURRENT_ACCOUNT`.

```
WITH AccountTotal AS (
    SELECT u.id, COUNT(account_id)
    FROM accounts AS a
    JOIN users AS u ON a.user_id = u.id AND a.type = 'CURRENT_ACCOUNT'
    GROUP BY u.id
)
SELECT COUNT(id) AS total_accounts_multiple_current
FROM AccountTotal
WHERE COUNT > 1;
```


3. List the top five accounts with more money.

```
SELECT concat(u.name, ' ', u.last_name) AS user, a.account_id, a.mount
FROM accounts AS a
JOIN users AS u ON a.user_id = u.id 
ORDER BY mount DESC
LIMIT 5
```


4. Get the three users with the most money after making movements.

```
SELECT u.name AS user, SUM((CASE WHEN m.type = 'IN' THEN m.mount ELSE - m.mount END) + a.mount) AS net_amount
FROM users AS u
JOIN accounts AS a ON u.id = a.user_id
JOIN movements AS m ON m.account_from = a.id
GROUP BY u.name
ORDER BY net_amount DESC
LIMIT 3
;
```


5. In this part you need to create a transaction with the following steps:

    a. First, get the ammount for the account `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf` and `fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590` after all their movements.
    b. Add a new movement with the information:
        from: `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf` make a transfer to `fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590`
        mount: 50.75

    c. Add a new movement with the information:
        from: `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf` 
        type: OUT
        mount: 731823.56

        * Note: if the account does not have enough money you need to reject this insert and make a rollback for the entire transaction
    
    d. Put your answer here if the transaction fails(YES/NO):
    ```
        Yes, because the amount exceeds the avialable funds the user has.
    ```

    e. If the transaction fails, make the correction on step _c_ to avoid the failure:
    ```
        DECLARE
            amount_to_withdraw NUMERIC := 731823.56
            user_balance NUMERIC;

        SELECT mount 
        INTO user_balance 
        FROM accounts 
        WHERE id = '3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf'

        IF user_balance > amount_to_withdraw THEN
            INSERT INTO movements (id, type, account_from, account_to, mount, created_at, updated_at)
            VALUES (
                uuid_generate_v4(),
                'OUT',
                '3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf',
                NULL,
                amount_to_withdraw,
                NOW(),
                NOW()
            );
        ELSE
            ROLLBACK;
        END IF;
    ```

    f. Once the transaction is correct, make a commit
    ```
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

    UPDATE accounts
    SET mount = (
        SELECT SUM((CASE WHEN m.type = 'IN' THEN m.mount ELSE - m.mount END) + a.mount) AS balance

        50.75,

    );

    UPDATE accounts
    SET mount = (
        SELECT SUM(a.mount - 50.75) AS balance
        FROM accounts AS a
        JOIN movements AS m ON a.id = m.account_from

        IF user_balance > 731823.56 THEN
            INSERT INTO movements (id, type, account_from, account_to, mount, created_at, updated_at)
            VALUES (
